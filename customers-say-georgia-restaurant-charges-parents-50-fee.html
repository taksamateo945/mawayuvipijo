Holy moly – the most disrespectful owner made a huge scene in front of the entire restaurant because our children were ‘running through the restaurant’ – they were down by the river.. we were told we need to ‘go to Burger King and Walmart’ and that we were bad parents,” Danielle Hampy wrote on Google Reviews. “They have a $50 surcharge for ‘bad children.’ We were a group of 21, and our server was AMAZING and was overly apologetic. Terrible business practice; we will never be back.”</p><p>“The owner came out and told me he was adding $50 to my bill because of my children’s behavior. My kids watched a tablet until the food arrived, ate their food and my wife took them outside while I waited and paid the bill,” Kyle Landmann also wrote on Google Reviews.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Read the original story here.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmxpX5jCtMDOppyrq12orrp5xp6mq5%2BZlnqzsdKtmK6qkaPBbq%2FHmqmgnaNivaK%2BxKerrGVlZXqnscRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-nikki-era-premieres-fantasy-boy-lyric-video.html><span>←</span><span>EXCLUSIVE: Nikki Era premieres &amp;quot;Fantasy Boy&amp;quot; Lyric Video</span></a>
