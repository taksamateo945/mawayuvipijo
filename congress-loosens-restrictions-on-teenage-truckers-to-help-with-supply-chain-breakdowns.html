“There’s going to be accidents. That’s just the fact of it,” said Eric Cane, truck driver.
This program is intended to help with the truck driver shortage."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Before the program, truckers had to be at least 21-years-old to cross state lines, but this is an exception.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“There’s going to be accidents. That’s just the fact of it,” said Eric Cane, truck driver.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">This program is intended to help with the truck driver shortage.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">U.S. Xpress, one of the nation’s largest truckload carriers, said the industry needs at least 80,000 new truckers. It lost 6% of its workers since the pandemic began and struggles with recruitment.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“It’s a lot more freight for us. It’s hard out there definitely– at this point it’s overwhelming,” Harrington added.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“If there’s such a shortage of truck drivers, why can’t we find places to park. I just don’t believe it,” said Cane.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has specific rules for applicants:</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><ul class="sc-bwzfXH cvFdtK font_openSans articleList" readability=24><li class="sc-bwzfXH dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 cSLcQo" readability=-1><p><span class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gTMliN">No previous driving while impaired violations</span></p></li><li class="sc-bwzfXH dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 cSLcQo" readability=-1><p><span class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gTMliN">No traffic tickets for causing a crash</span></p></li></ul><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">Under the apprenticeship, younger drivers can cross state lines during 120-hour and 280-hour probationary periods, as long as an experienced driver is in the passenger seat. Trucks used in the program have to have an electronic braking crash mitigation system, a forward-facing video camera, and their speeds must be limited to 65 mph.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“Back in the day I was young, and I had a seasoned driver with me so definitely that makes me feel okay and much better being on the road, said Harrington.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“I just don’t think they’ve got the experience overall to handle different climates and conditions,” said Cane.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">Apprentice drivers can cross state lines up to 280 hours during supervised probationary periods.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">After probation, they can drive on their own, but companies must monitor their performance until they’re 21. No more than 3,000 apprentices can take part in the training at any given time.</p><p>Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4Jax – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6S7qL7ErKpmpJ%2BkwKa60mapnqukp7akwMiopaxln6N6tbHEp5ignV2pv7avyp6prGWkpHqpscupZLChpJ16tMHPqaOyZZOdrqq6jJupnpmbmby4utJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./t-i-explains-what-a-king-is-in-his-opinion-check-out-his-message-313250.html><span>←</span><span>T.I.
