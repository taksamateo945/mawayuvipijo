Perhaps the most traic and disturbing event in the hotel’s history was the 1978 murder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Nancy Spungen</a>. Spungen — the girlfriend of Sex Pistols bassist <a href=# rel=noopener>Sid Vicious</a> — was found dead in the bathroom of Room 100, per the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a>. Spungen had been stabbed in the stomach, and police quickly arrested Vicious and charged him with the murder (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>). Vicious died of a heroin overdose before going to trial, and there remains speculation over whether or not he was the culprit. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox 5</a>, Spungen’s spirit is said to still haunt the Chelsea Hotel.</p><p dir=ltr>Welsh poet Dylan Thomas died at the Chelsea Hotel in 1953 at just 38 years old. In a 2004 review of the book “<a href=# rel=noopener>Dylan Remembered: 1935-1953</a>,” <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a> reports that Thomas suffered from alcohol addiction and is said to have remarked, “18 straight whiskies; I think it’s a record” during his last binge that contributed to his death. However, new evidence suggests that it wasn’t alcohol that killed Thomas, but instead, it was a bout with pneumonia and mistakes made by doctors. His ghost is said to roam around one of his frequent hangout spots at the Chelsea Hotel: the bar.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
