The Amapiano artist addressed the <a href=#>drama between himself and Shebe</a> that arose from the <a href=#>Limpopo</a> rapper's infamous <i>Podcast and Chill</i> interview.</p><p class=align-left>X user <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Maluda012</a> shared Foca's Instagram live, revealing no hate between himself and Shebe. Foca also apologized that Shebe didn't feel appreciated after performing at the Straata Nation Address:</p>"I probably didn't post him how he wanted but that's my dawg. I've posted him before, Shebeshxt is my dawg, we'd never fight no matter what podcasts do. I love him and I'm sorry if you feel like you were disrespected, I'd never disrespect the streets.""About the payment issue, I called him for the show [Straata Nation Address] and asked how much he charges. Everyone knows that I pay people for my shows but he wanted to do it out of love and I also respect that. I love him, the problem is that people love beef, no matter what he wants, I got him.""If he feels like I didn't give him a proper shout-out, I'm willing to fix that. The streets don't fight.<p class=align-left>Foca revealed that he was meant to feature Shebeshxt on an Amapiano song, but the collaboration never happened.</p><h2>Mzansi weighs in on Focalistic's video</h2><p class=align-left>Netizens gave their thoughts on Focalistic's apology to Shebeshxt, where some claimed that he's afraid of Shebe while others weren't convinced of his apology:</p><p class=align-left>paballo_maseko said:</p>"But he won’t address the allegations of him stealing from struggling Bacardi artists because it’s true."<p class=align-left>Mama_KGOTLI wrote:</p>"Focalistic is scared of Shebeshxt, it's cute!"<p class=align-left>lufunoRonald10 claimed:</p>"He is scared of him!"<h2>Shebeshxt confesses to crime</h2><p class=align-left>In more Shebeshxt updates, <strong>Briefly News</strong> caught online reactions to the <a href=#>rapper</a> <a href=#>confessing to his crimes</a> on <i>Podcast and Chill </i>and had his fans coming for his defence:</p><p class=align-left>PotsisoMocheke said:</p>"He said they must come so he can give them back."<p class=align-left>The <i>Ambulance</i> rapper <a href=#>had Sol Phenduka suspiciously quiet</a> throughout the interview and raised many <a href=#>eyebrows</a> among viewers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKa6056prZmZo7qmutNomp6klZe%2FqsDInqpoaWdpfXOBjJ%2BmnJmcnsC1tcJmqZ6roKS7pb%2BMrJ%2BempWotbnAjKmmnZuRqMFur8eio6VllKeurq2O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamar-braxton-calls-out-sister-toni-braxton-for-doing-what-sisters-do-and-fans-are-in-stitches.html><span>←</span><span>Tamar Braxton Calls Out Sister Toni Braxton for Doing What Sisters Do and Fans Are in Stitches</span></a>
