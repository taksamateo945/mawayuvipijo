There have been rumors that that he has a daughter whose name is Darcy Anne Styles, but it has since been clarified that the girl is not his child and she is mostly a product of fan fiction.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The only time the actor came close to becoming a father was in the capacity of a step-dad to the two kids of his ex-lover, Olivia Wilde. While he is not yet a father, he has revealed in the past, that he was looking forward to having kids in the future. Here is all to know about the issue of Harry Styles having kids.</p><h2><strong>Does Harry Styles Have a Child?</strong></h2><p>No, Harry Styles does not have a child, contrary to all the claims. The singer has never been married at any point in the past, neither does he have a baby mama. More so, he has never seemed to be very eager to have kids, even though it is believed that he has a great relationship with children.</p><p>As indicated, it was claimed that he once fathered a child, a daughter named Darcy Anne Styles. According to the rumor, the former One Direction singer had Darcy on March 22, 2020, and is now claimed to be 3 years old. Some of the reports went as far as claiming that the birth of Darcy changed the life and perspective of Harry Styles, but as it turned out, the child that was claimed to be his daughter was not his.</p><p>While the story is believed by many to be factual, it actually began years ago as fan fiction on the internet when someone claimed that the singer got a fan pregnant. The plot became popular on the internet. Social media users and different blogs fed on it as real news and that was how the news started going around that the singer had a daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/Harry-Styles-child-1-e1696869610587.jpg><p>While he has not out rightly debunked the rumor, he only indicated that he has a goddaughter with whom he is very close. The image making the rounds of him and his alleged daughter is believed to be him and his goddaughter.</p><h2><strong>Who Does Harry Styles Have a Child With?</strong></h2><p>Harry Styles does not have a child with anyone since he is still not yet a father. More so, the rumors claiming that he was the father of the girl alleged to be Darcy Anne Styles have not revealed who he might have had the kid with. The woman he was dating at the time in question was <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Olivia Wilde,</a> whom he dated for two years from 2020 to 2022.</p><p>On her own, the 39-year-old actress and filmmaker is a mother of two kids; son Otis Alexander and daughter Daisy Josephine. Wilde had her kids with her ex, Jason Sudeikis. While her first child, Otis, was born in 2014, which makes him 9 years old, her second child, Daisy, was born in 2016 and is now 7 years old.</p><p>Harry Styles did not get to become the stepfather of the kids, but while he dated Olivia Wilde, it was once rumored that the two had secretly gotten married, suggesting that he now had the official role of a stepfather in the life of the kids, but it turned out that there was no truth to the claim. Sadly, the relationship came to an end in 2022 without the pair finally making it down the aisle.</p><p>Other women that Harry Styles dated but did not have any children with are Caroline Flack, who was his first known lover, Emma Ostilly, Taylor Swift, Cara Delevigne, and Paige Reifler, whom he was rumored to have dated from 2013 to 2014. Next, he was linked to Kendall Jenner from 2013 to 2016, then Nadine Leopold, Townes Hones, and Camille Rowe, after which he got into one of his most known relationships with the aforementioned actress, Olivia Wilde.</p><h2><strong>He Has Plans of Having Kids in The Future</strong></h2><p>The new king of pop, as he is called, revealed that he would love to have children of his own in the future. While he is not rushing to become a father, he made it known that at any point in the future, if he has children, he is going to encourage them to among other things, be themselves and be vulnerable. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>He also said</a> he would encourage them to share.</p><p>One of the things that made him love kids is the closeness and bond that he shared with the two kids of his former lover, Olivia Wilde, while their relationship lasted.</p><p>The sexuality of the singer has been questioned for a long time, but it has since been established that he is straight. Nonetheless, he revealed that he was once embarrassed to let people know that he was sexually active. It is not known if this is one of the reasons he has not had kids much earlier, but he has since made it known that he has gotten over the fears and is comfortable in his skin.</p><p>With that said, it is not known how soon the singer may want to start having kids.</p><h2><strong>Harry Styles Has Great Love For Kids</strong></h2><p>One thing that the British-born singer is known for apart from the fact that he was close to Olivia Wilde’s kids is that he is a lover of children, looking at his activities in the past.</p><p>In 2023, the singer raised over £5 million for different charity causes during his world tour. One such is Save The Children and Planned Parenthood, showing his love and dedication to matters relating to kids.</p><p>More so, he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>was once tagged</a> as the perfect daddy-to-be by fans after a video of him appeared on Instagram. In the video, the Brit whose affinity to children is undeniable, was seen affectionately holding a toddler.</p><h2><b>FAQs</b></h2><h3><strong>How Many Children Does Harry Styles Have?</strong></h3><p>Harry Styles does not have any kids even though for a long time it was believed that he had a daughter, Darcy.</p><h3><strong>Is Harry Styles Married?</strong></h3><p>Harry Styles is not married and he has never been married in the past, even though he has been in several relationships in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLGwsdJmn5qqoq56tMDYpZysZZiWw6Z5wGaaoaGcmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-michael.html><span>←</span><span>George Michael - CelebNetWorth</span></a>
