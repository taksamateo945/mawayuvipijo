Following yet another early playoff exit, they've responded with a shockingly quiet offseason.</p><p>One of Dallas' most notable moves was bringing back running back Ezekiel Elliott. The aging veteran spent the 2023 season with the New England Patriots after the Cowboys released him well before his blockbuster six-year, $90 million contract extension ran out.</p><p>Elliott is much more affordable now that he's back on a one-year, $2 million deal, but it remains to be seen if can return to form in his ninth NFL season. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones seems to be confident that the 28-year-old still has enough gas left in the tank to lead the team's backfield.</p><p>"I saw him play his last games with New England," Jones said of Elliott, per CBS Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Garrett Podell</a>. "I thought he played well enough to be a starter."</p><p>Elliott rushed for only 642 yards and three touchdowns on 184 totes last year, all of which were career-low marks. He did fare better as a pass-catcher, picking up 313 yards and a pair of scores on 51 receptions, which were his best marks since 2020.</p><p>Dallas doesn't have many options if Elliott continues to regress. After letting incumbent starter Tony Pollard walk in free agency, the team has only inexperienced or ineffective backs like Rico Dowdle, Deuce Vaughn and Royce Freeman behind Elliott.</p><p>Barring a late signing, the Cowboys are placing a ton of trust in Elliott to rejuvenate his career and lift this unit. Given that Dallas was barely better than league average in rushing yardage last year and Elliott's Patriots ranked 26th, it's a tough ask.</p><p>That could ultimately be Dallas' downfall in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiCcoSMamSnnpxiva2t2J6pZq%2BYpHq4tculZKaZm5p6sL6Mm6memZtisrex0bJkrK2gmr9urs6wo2abn6PBprrDnqlmoZ5if3F%2Bkw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./763948-40-most-intimidating-players-in-nfl-history.html><span>←</span><span>The 40 Most Intimidating Players in NFL History | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</span></a>
