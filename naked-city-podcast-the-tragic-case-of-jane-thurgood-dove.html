In this series, you will hear recordings of some of Australia’s most dangerous criminals, all of whom have been remarkably frank in their recollections.</p><p>A murder investigation begins at the source and works its way out in growing circles. This is because it is an established fact that you are most likely to be killed by someone close to you.</p><p>When Jane Thurgood-Dove was murdered in front of her three children in the driveway of their Muriel Street, Niddrie, home in November 1997, her husband Mark was told he would be treated as a suspect until proven otherwise. He co-operated fully and the police quickly moved to the next ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.434%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_12%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/7c1b7be49fe784ea96ae1adfaa96708f0d6d74b0><p>Examining Jane’s immediate past, they found a serving policeman obsessed with the married woman, so much so that soon after her death he tried to buy a cemetery plot near her grave. And he fitted the description of the pot-bellied gunman. For years he was treated as the prime suspect. The trouble was, he didn’t do it.</p><p>Elsewhere in Muriel Street lived another young family that was anything but average.</p><p>The likeable Carmel married the unlikeable Peter Kyprianou, a career crook and opportunistic conman. Together they had two children and moved into a home just up the road from the Thurgood-Doves.</p><p>Just a few years earlier, an old business contact had planned to abduct, torture and kill Kyprianou over a $200,000 fraud sting that went wrong.</p><p>That business contact was former Crown solicitor Philip Peters, who became known as “Mr Laundry” because he could wash millions of dirty dollars for underworld figures.</p><p>In April 1994 Peters was charged with conspiracy to murder Kyprianou. He was released in 1997, a few months before Jane Thurgood-Dove was murdered.</p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>smh.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnpa4prCMnKCtsV2lvKWvwKyrZqyYmnq1vsCgoJxlk5bApnnOn2SjmZ6aerW01KueqKeUYrGwwsRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./belen-salomon.html><span>←</span><span>Belen Salomon</span></a>
