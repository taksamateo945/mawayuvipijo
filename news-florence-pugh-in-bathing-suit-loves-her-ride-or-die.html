For me, I loved all of that because I grew up with a lot of dance and a lot of movement. I was always fighting my brother [actor and musician Toby Sebastian], so I find all of that combat stuff so exciting.

"I wanted to know whether it was them or me calling the shots. That was a big deal for me. I didn't want to be part of something where I was constantly checked on. And people making sure I was in the 'right' shape. That's not me at all." She added:&nbsp; "Scarlett had this amazing guy who cooked beautiful things for her and her team. I thought that was clever because you're doing fitness all the time and you need to have someone who's on top of what you're eating and the nutrients you're getting. I remember her asking, 'Why are you cooking for yourself? Just let us feed you!' And I was like, 'Nope.'"&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/florence-pugh-1001.jpg><p><span>"I did a job where it was made very apparent that I needed to lose weight and when it was over, I was very aware I didn't want to do that kind of work," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour</span></a><span>.

"Tracheomalacia is a rare condition that happens when the cartilage of the windpipe, or trachea, is soft, weak and floppy. This can cause the tracheal wall to collapse and block the airway, making it hard to breathe," says Cedars-Sinai. "Tracheomalacia can have no symptoms, especially if the condition is very mild. However, the more the airway is blocked, the more severe the symptoms are. Symptoms of tracheomalacia are often attributed to other conditions, such as </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>emphysema</span></a><span> or </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>asthma</span></a><span>."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkn6Sfp7Kvr8Rmp66fmGK2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1kpaemmsButMSrZKuhlJp6sL6MnaCeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./take-the-plunge-into-a-pool-say-html.html><span>←</span><span>Take the plunge into a pool say</span></a>
