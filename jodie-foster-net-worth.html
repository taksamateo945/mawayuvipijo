Jodie Foster began her career as a child in such films as “Tom Sawyer,” “Bugsy Malone,” and “Freaky Friday.” She later achieved critical success and numerous industry awards for her performances in “The Accused,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” and “Nell,” among other films. As a director, Foster’s credits include the films “Little Man Tate,” “Home for the Holidays,” “The Beaver,” and “Money Monster,” as well as episodes of the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black.”</p><p><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></p><p>Jodie Foster was born as Alicia Christian Foster on November 19, 1962 in Los Angeles, California. She was the youngest child of Evelyn and Lucius, who had divorced before she was born. Foster is of Irish, English, and German ancestry, and is a descendant of Mayflower passenger John Alden. She has three full siblings, Lucinda, Constance, and Lucius, as well as three half-brothers from her father’s earlier marriage. A gifted child, Foster started to read at the age of three. At the same age, she began her career with an appearance in a Coppertone television commercial. This led to further advertising appearances, and then to a minor appearance on the sitcom “Mayberry R.F.D.” in 1968. Foster went on to appear in more than 50 television shows over the subsequent years; among her most notable credits were recurring roles on the sitcoms “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father” and “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.” On film, Foster made her debut in 1972’s “Napoleon and Samantha.” She followed this with roles in “Kansas City Bomber,” “One Little Indian,” “Tom Sawyer,” and Martin Scorsese’s “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”</p><p>For her education, Foster went to the French-language preparatory school Lycée Français de Los Angeles, from which she graduated as valedictorian in 1980. Subsequently, she enrolled at Yale University with a major in African-American literature; she graduated magna cum laude in 1985.</p><p><strong>Teenage Fame</strong></p><p>In 1976, Foster reunited with Martin Scorsese for “Taxi Driver,” in which she had her breakthrough role playing child prostitute Iris Steensma. The film was a massive success, winning the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Moreover, Foster received numerous plaudits for her performance, including her first Academy Award nomination. The young actress starred in four other films in 1976: the family drama “Echoes of a Summer,” the gangster musical comedy “Bugsy Malone,” the thriller “The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane,” and the Disney fantasy “Freaky Friday.” Following this watershed year, Foster spent nine months living in France, where she starred in the film “Moi, flour bleue.” She went on to appear in the Italian comedy “Casotto” and the Disney family adventure “Candleshoe.”</p><p><strong>Film Career in the 80s and 90s</strong></p><p>Foster transitioned into more adult roles in the 1980s. Her credits early in the decade included “Foxes,” “Carny,” “O’Hara’s Wife,” “Svengali,” “The Hotel New Hampshire,” and “The Blood of Others.” She followed these with roles in “Mesmerized,” “Five Corners,” “Siesta,” and “Stealing Home.” Foster’s acting breakthrough as an adult came in the 1988 legal drama “The Accused,” in which she played a rape survivor fighting for justice. For her performance, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.</p><p>Following her role in 1990’s “Catchfire,” Foster gave her most acclaimed and iconic performance in the 1991 thriller “The Silence of the Lambs.” She played FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who uses incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter to track down another serial killer who’s on the loose. The film was one of the biggest commercial and critical successes of the year; it went on to win five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, and another Best Actress honor for Foster.
