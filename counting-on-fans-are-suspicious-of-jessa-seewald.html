Many of them believe that Jim Bob Duggar will get the kids to divert attention away from things he doesn’t want them to know.</p><p>Is that what went down in the last day or so?</p><h2>Counting On Alum Jessa Seewald Announced Her Pregnancy</h2><p>Happy that she fell pregnant and <a href=#>expects a fifth child</a>, Jesse mentioned it very briefly in a video on her YouTube. Then, she went on and revealed a lot about their getaway.</p><p>It was the first one ever. Of course, the kids were seen as well. However, people wonder why she chose now to tell her followers about the new baby.</p><p>After all, it’s not like it’s something that seldom happens in the Duggar family.</p><p>Some Counting On fans suspect it might be because her much more popular sister, <a href=#>Jill Dillard</a> was on the cusp of launching her new book called Counting The Cost.</p><p>Of course, it seemed that Jim Bob and Ben Seewald were not overly thrilled about Jill in Amazon’s docuseries.</p><p>She let a lot of cats out of the bag when she opened up on Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets.</p><p>So, it’s unlikely that they celebrate a Tell-All, memoir that makes the family look bad. Already, some alarming content leaked.</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;</p><h3>Counting On – Is Jessa Posting For Distraction From Jill’s Book?</h3><p>Redditors seem convinced that Jill’s sister is posting in order to take the focus off Jill and her book.</p><p>There’s been a lot of interest in it, and some people believe that Jim Bob might have told Jessa Seewald to post more. On Reddit, u/HiiViolet noted; “In case you were keeping track…That would be 16, yes sixteen posts Jessa made Sunday night as a ninth inning distraction from Jill’s book release.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1.jpg><p>Other Counting On critics took up the conversation and it turned out to be quite an interesting thread. Here are some of the replies:</p><ul><li>Agile-Variety3150: “Ah yes. I’m so much more interested in the #sayingsofspurgeon then Jill burning down the TTH. What will he say next?!”</li><li>GenX-IA: “She hadn’t posted in months, now she’s posting more than Joy.”</li><li>MooCowMoooo: “She’s getting paid per post by Jim Bob.</li><li>Suckerforcats: “So she doesn’t post for months and then all of a sudden, a flurry of posts? I think if I had to pick most vindictive Duggar daughter, she would be it.</li><li>GreenCoasting: “I’m embarrassed for her. The combination of it all—being your dad’s puppet, the public performance, exploiting stupid stuff about your kids, undermining something major of a sister’s, and putting on display just how stupid you are—it’s all so pathetic.”</li></ul><h3>What Are Your Thoughts?</h3><p>Do you think that Counting On alum&nbsp; Jessa Seewald went on a posting spree to divert attention away from the book launch of her sister, Jill Dillard?</p><p>Do you think it made any difference to the people wanting to buy Counting The Cost?
