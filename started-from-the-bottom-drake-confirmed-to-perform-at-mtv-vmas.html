Drizzy is scheduled to perform his song “Started From The Bottom”&nbsp;on live television for the first time. According to MTV.com:</p><p>“As if his infectious hit wasn’t proof enough,&nbsp;Drake&nbsp;is proving that he’s here when he returns to the&nbsp;MTV Video Music Awards&nbsp;on Sunday to give his first live television performance of ‘Started from the Bottom.’</p><p>“The video for his&nbsp;<i>Nothing Was the Same</i>&nbsp;lead single is up for two awards at this year’s show, including Best Direction and Best Hip Hop Video. (And judging from his&nbsp;tweet&nbsp;Wednesday morning, he’s particularly motivated to go home with one of the coveted&nbsp;<a href=#>Kaws-designed Moonmen</a>. While he was there at last year’s VMAs to accept the Best Hip Hop award for “HYFR” with Lil Wayne, this will mark his first performance since 2010.”</p><p>The news isn’t all good from Drake’s camp. While he will be performing the lead single from his upcoming album, “<i>Nothing Was The Same,” </i>the album has been reportedly pushed back. According to vibe.com:</p><p>“But the good news comes with a minor setback as the Toronto MC will be pushing back the release of his album by one week. According to&nbsp;Hits Daily Double&nbsp;andBest Buy,&nbsp;<i>NWTS</i>&nbsp;is now scheduled to hit shelves Sept. 24.”</p><p>That’s only a week’s difference, so the delay shouldn’t affect fans much. In today’s digital distribution age, albums typically get leaked early—so fans may end up with the original September 17 date after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX50e49xZmtpX6jBor7TnptmnqKkum7Ax55km6ekqbyuecOrmKSdXZi8r7LIq6SenF2pvG68xKudqKqdYq61ecytrWaunZbAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fire-on-fire-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>Fire On Fire Lyrics</span></a>
