He proved his family wrong and became very successful as an artist, I’m sure his family had been proud of him.</p><p>During the early days of his carrier, he used to participate in local cultural activities as a guitarist in Saigon (1976-1977). And then in 1981, he was sent to America a country of freedom, to learn English and computers to have a well-settled life there. But even the family pressure couldn’t stop him from becoming a successful artist. After going to the US he officially started his carrier there as a musician, against the wish of his family. He took classes in jazz and also learned piano and then formed a band ‘Chi Tai’s brothers’. It was a family band where Chi Thien was on the keyboard, Phuong Loan(his wife) was a vocalist,&nbsp; Quang My in bassKieu Linh on trumpet, Trinh Nam Son on saxophone and keyboard whereas he himself was the guitarist. Initially, they use to perform in programs, wedding ceremonies, etc. And soon their works got recognized by Thuy&nbsp; Nga center from Paris by Night18. Chi first appeared on the Vietnamese variety show Paris By Night in 1992.</p><p>Then his carrier moved forward at a great speed, he opened his own concert studio and recorded for many foreign singers. His carrier was going quite smoothly and suddenly after 10 years of being in the music industry, he decided to switch his carrier and become an actor and a comedian.</p><p>In 1997, he was given a chance to perform with Hoai Linh as a comedian, due to a lack of actors. The entertainment industry gave him more name and fame than the music industry. He got numerous roles in films, T.V series. He is best known for his works in Hung Ali(2015), Them Chut Nua(2016), Five Fairies in the house(2013), Cho Em Gan Anh, etc. Recently he was seen in a movie called The Perfect Wedding in 2019. His other works are Hello Vietnam, Jackpot, and T.V series such as Whose Line is it Anyway. After ruling the entertainment industry for almost two decades the world had to say goodbye to such an incredible artist.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The exact net worth of Chi is unknown. But as he is a famous Vietnamese actor, comedian, and musician his net worth is predicted to be above million dollars.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chi_Tai_Wife_Phuong_Loan></span><strong>Chi Tai Wife Phuong Loan</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chi Tai got Married to wife Phuong Loan (the lead singer of the band Chi Tai brothers) in 1987. They were the real example of couple goals. They were together when the band was formed, they were together when the band stopped performing together because Chi wanted to join the entertainment industry and they were together when they had to be in a long-distance due to Chi’s profession and they were together till the death departed them apart. In 33 years of their marriage, they were in a long-distance relationship for about 17 years because Chi had to go to Vietnam often for shooting, he used to have a packed schedule and she was in the USA.</p><p>But they were very good at enjoying those little moments they shared. He used to appreciate her and expressed how much he loved her publicly. And yesterday she lost her man, the love of her life. We pray to God to give her strength to overcome this great loss.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media_Stormed_by_Chis_Death></span>Social Media Stormed by Chi’s Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Many celebrities and his beloved fans posted and tweeted expressing about the untimely death of Chi.
