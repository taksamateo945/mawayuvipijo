As far as the reality TV star is concerned, the measures are too extreme since the virus is really not that dangerous at all!</p><p>Joe shared his opinion on the situation on video while showing how his Salerno neighborhood looked like a complete ‘ghost town’ because of the quarantine.</p><p>Teresa Giudice’s estranged husband mocked the fears as well in the clip he posted on his Instagram page by pointing out that even Viagra pills cause more deaths than the Covid19 strand of the Coronavirus!</p><p>Joe filmed the empty streets, sidewalk and the buildings in his neighborhood and called the lockdown ‘ridiculous.’</p><p>Obviously frustrated, Joe went on to explain that ‘More people die from Viagra (heart attacks and drug overdose) everyday than this Coronavirus. People here are so frantic because government’s ridiculous with 🔒down !!!! Sorry Lockdown not for me Never again !!!!! Stay safe 🌎 eat healthy, exercise, no shaking and 🧼 👏!’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9jUcTfgZfZ/</p><p>Judging by the comments he received in the comment section, it looks like a lot of people agreed with Joe’s point of view.</p><p>One follower told Joe that he should let people know it’s actually safe to travel there.</p><p>In response, the man wrote that one should ‘always take safety advice. I was in prison for 4 years the key’s to always wash your hands and you will be ok.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Other fans chimed in as well, writing comments such as: ‘Yea it’s crazy.’ / ‘People are all worried here in the states too but still going to work.’ / ‘It’s insane all of my relatives in Italy are telling me not to come in April for Easter so had to cancel everything and it is not even in their hometown but in the states it is no better.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapLJus8ium6KblWKworjLrGSirJGhxrR5y6iapJyfrLturcyim2asmJp6pLvRqKWarpmnwrR5z5qlnZ2dnrBuvsidoJytnKTCtHnMqKmeZaCavLG4xGabop1dm7%2BwuYyvoJqfopZ6dIOWanByZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./female-turkey-html.html><span>←</span><span>Female turkey</span></a>
