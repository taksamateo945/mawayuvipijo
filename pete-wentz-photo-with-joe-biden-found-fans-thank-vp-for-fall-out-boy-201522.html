The entry was published on Nov. 4, 2008 — the day American voters cast their votes in the presidential election between <strong><a href=#>Barack Obama</a></strong> and his running mate Biden and <strong>John McCain</strong> and his VP candidate <strong><a href=#>Sarah Palin</a></strong>.</p><p>“So I guess its a big day for everyone — one way or another no matter what you are thinking,” Wentz, now 35, <a href=#>wrote on his personal website at the time</a>. “I don’t really want to force my views on anyone. I’m just some guy in a band who doesn’t spell that great much less have a degree in anything. So I turned to my dad (has a couple degrees and spells much better, besides he’s a hero to me). Blech enough of that… Here’s what he had to say…”</p><p>“‘I have spent the weekend and now working on the Obama campaign,” Wentz continued, quoting his father,<strong> Pete Wentz Sr.</strong> “‘Mom and I met in Washington when we were both legislative assistants to Senator Biden when he was in his first term. I had worked in his campaign and your mother had been in the Foreign Service. We started out as friends and the rest is history.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Wentz shared the tidbit of family history along with a vintage photo of himself as a little boy in the arms of now-VP Biden. Then a senator representing Delaware, Biden grins at the future rock star as his mother, Dale Lewis Wentz, looks on.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That picture is me, Joe Biden and my mom,” the rocker added. “Wow, I’m like the same height still.”</p><p>Tumblr users found the post in Wentz’s archives and it quickly took off, getting rapidly reblogged throughout Sunday, Feb. 1, and Monday, Feb. 2. Fans of the “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)” musicians took to Twitter to thank Biden for the existence of Wentz, and, in turn, the band.&nbsp;</p><p>“So Pete Wentz’s parents met working on a Joe Biden campaign which means if it weren’t for Joe Biden Fall Out Boy wouldn’t exist,” <a href=#>one fan tweeted</a>, while <a href=#>another wrote</a>, “@vp @JoeBiden hi, I love you, and also thank you for allowing @petewentz to exist and therefore creating @falloutboy you rock.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKeerJVixKa607NkqaCfqbxuw8itn2ain5p6o7XDnqVmnp%2Bqu6V5xZqlrGWkna6vt4yvp2aen6d6p63LpWSoraRir7DFjGtnam1iZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-tillis.html><span>←</span><span>Mel Tillis Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
