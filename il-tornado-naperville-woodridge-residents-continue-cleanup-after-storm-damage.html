We’ll put together and we will for sure come through this.”</p><p><b><a href=#>Teen rescues brother, 6, as storm destroys second floor of home</a></b></p><p>Mayor Chirico also warning tornado victims to watch out for scammers and asking neighbors to keep looking out for each other.</p><p>The cleanup process in Woodridge is fully underway because the community has stepped up.</p><p>At least 100 homes were damaged and many areas are still littered with trees.
