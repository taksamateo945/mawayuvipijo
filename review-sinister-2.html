It has to be said that throughout the film both Robert and Dartanian worked wonderfully with the very graphic and adult content they had written for them; yet it provided another feature of the film that felt quite disjointed, the amount of&nbsp;physical and verbally abusive scenes got to the point where they lost their shock value and simply became uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>But, with this family comes a sub-plot of martial and child abuse that caused Courtney to take her kids away from the overpowering presence of their father Clint (Lea Coco). It provided a clever excuse for both of the children’s strange behaviour, so much so that the mother never questioned what her children were really seeing until it was too late.</p><p>However, the sloppy aspects of the film stemmed from its comedic dialogue, particularly from the mouth of our Ex-Deputy (James Ransone)- although I have a feeling he was only there to serve as comic relief, given his like-ability. The deaths in this film were far more gruesome and elaborate; but slightly inconceivable for a child to commit. It was clear that director, Ciaran Foy was going for dramatic, face-squirming, have-to-look-away-you’re-that-disgusted deaths, so&nbsp;in that respect he succeeded.</p><p>What should have felt like a natural extension of Sinister, a continuation of all its effective scares and devices, sadly felt more like a amateur’s attempt at&nbsp;it&nbsp;that relied&nbsp;repulsing the audience because they couldn’t scare us with what they had produced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv6bCyJ6uZquZo7a0wMSrZGtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./first-muppets-trailer-for-abc-is-all-kinds-of-awesome-watch-2015125.html><span>←</span><span>First Muppets Trailer for ABC Is All Kinds of Awesome: Watch</span></a>
