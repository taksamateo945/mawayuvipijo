It was even critically acclaimed for its more mature sound that wasn’t so easily captured in their past singles discography.</p><p>Boy bands may come and go, but just like the any other boy band, their songs will be played nostalgically all the time. That’s where the “test of time” comes in.</p><p>Will One Direction win that test?</p><p>It certainly seems like it!</p><p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJO3ROT-A4E]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kfqV5zqecZpqZnLSmv9NmpK6rmZh6o77EmqKtoKKkwqi00mabnpuRmbJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-thomas-playlist-2015278.html><span>←</span><span>Rob Thomas' Top '90s Tracks</span></a>
