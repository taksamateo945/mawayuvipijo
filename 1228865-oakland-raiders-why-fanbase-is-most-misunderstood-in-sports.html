Someone parents wouldn’t want their kids around.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact of the matter is, though, that Raiders fans are misunderstood.&nbsp;</p><p>The first reason for this is their ties to gang culture. &nbsp;The Raiders logo is forever associated with NWA and the origins of gangsta rap. &nbsp;Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E were the forefathers of gangsta rap and, if you couldn’t tell, gangsta rap is associated with gangs, violence, and crime. &nbsp;Watch the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN 30 for 30 documentary Straight Outta LA</a> if you don’t understand what I’m talking about.&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe the image of the stereotypical Raiders fan being a South Central LA gang member isn’t too far off, but the truth is that the guy repping Raiders gear to look cool isn’t truly a member of Raider Nation. &nbsp;I’m not saying that gang members can’t be fans of the Raiders. &nbsp;I’m not discriminating against gang members here but I am saying that the Raiders' strong association with gang culture has painted a picture of Raiders fans that is grossly inaccurate.&nbsp;</p><img alt="OAKLAND, CA - OCTOBER 16: A fan bows his head during a moment of silence for Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis before the Raiders game against the Cleveland Browns at O.co Coliseum on October 16, 2011 in Oakland, California.

It's either all the way, with great passion being a fan, or it's nothing. That's what being a Raider fan is."&nbsp;</p><p>Are Raiders fans rowdy? &nbsp;Yes, take a look at the Black Hole and the ridiculous costumes worn by followers of the Silver and Black. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A few bad apples have given a bad reputation to the entire Raider Nation crop. &nbsp;Raider Nation is rogue and Raider Nation might get a little overzealous at times, but they aren’t a mass gathering of criminals.&nbsp;</p><p>Raiders fans are some of the most passionate fans in the league but they are looked at like a stadium-sized meeting of gangbangers anonymous. &nbsp;The Oakland Raiders organization didn’t ask Eazy-E to don a Los Angeles Raiders snapback&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in this photograph</a> but he did and now the Raiders are suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>This article won’t change the world. &nbsp;Raider Nation will continue to be the most misunderstood fanbase in professional sports but the organization should be happy that they have such a diehard fanbase. They could be Jacksonville Jaguars fans...and no one wants that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGtqaG2DdnnOmqKlmZ6ZerOtyJ2cq6tdrLW6ecWapZuZo5p6qr%2BMpqasrF2itrTBzZ2cq6ukpLylecinZKyon6fBtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./set-of-first-aid-supplies-html.html><span>←</span><span>Set of first aid supplies</span></a>
