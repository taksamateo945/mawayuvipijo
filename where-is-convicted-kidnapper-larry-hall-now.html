Many cases in which Hall is suspected involved Jane Doe remains, or women who disappeared and whose bodies were not recovered. Some are still missing today. Many more women were reportedly stalked by a man fitting Hall’s description, in an area that Hall was known to frequent, or by a man in a vehicle that matched one that Hall was known to drive.</p><p dir=ltr>By 1995, though, Hall’s crimes had caught up with him and he was charged with kidnapping the Illinois teenager. At that point, Hall confessed to kidnapping and killing Jessica Roach, though he recanted his confession the next day (per <a href=# rel=noopener>The Cinemaholic</a>). He was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The convicted kidnapper would appeal his ruling, though, and go on to change his story, claiming he never actually hurt anyone. Shortly after that time, Hall allegedly admitted to&nbsp; at least one other kidnapping, as Radford University goes on to note.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6y1pr7EZqCsZZOku7e1wq2cnWWbnrGvrc%2BpnKtlnJa%2Fs8WMoZilpF2jvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soccer-highlight-nyt-4-letters-crossword-puzzle-clue-1291237.html><span>←</span><span>Soccer highlight NYT 4 letters Crossword Puzzle Clue</span></a>
