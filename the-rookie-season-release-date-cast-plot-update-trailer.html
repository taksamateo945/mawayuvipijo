After dropping out his college, he joined the construction business. A forty-year-old man packed his entire life and moved to Los Angeles to seek his dream of being a police officer after helping cops in a bank robbery case. His journey of becoming the oldest Rookie in LAPD, entering the dangerous and unforeseeable world of crime was quite<span data-preserver-spaces=true> interesting and fun-loving to watch in season 1.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Considering the season 2 final episode left not only Nolan on a cliff-hanger as well as all the viewers. The Rookie Police Officer was framed as a dirty cop by his mentor, who betrayed him. The betrayal from his friend completely reprimanded him. At the end of season 2, John Nolan was looking for evidence after he found that his mentor Nick Armstrong was working with <a href=#>Crime</a> Boss Serj Darien, he was going to reveal it. But Nick was one step ahead and planted the evidence against Nolan while he was caught by police.</span></p><p>In season 3, We witnessed Nolan’s attempt to prove his innocence. You also saw how he cleared his name from this mess. John Nolan swept up plaster dust at his house in the Season 3&nbsp;of The Rookie. However, it remains to be seen whether he can clean up the messes he has produced throughout his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-rookie-season-3-storyline.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Rookie Season 6 Plot: What Will Happen?</span></h2><p>The finale of Season 5 of The Rookie established a <a href=#>disturbing plot</a> for Season 6 as a series of coordinated attacks occurred against the squad. Although Luke Moran was apprehended for the attacks, John Nolan quickly became convinced that the suspect was not capable of orchestrating such a plan.</p><p><a href=#>Season 6</a> seems poised to introduce a new antagonist, portrayed by Kristian Bruun, who hired Luke and masterminded the attacks. Only time will reveal the intentions of the unnamed villain for the city, but his concluding statement in the Season 5 finale suggested that he had a specific target in mind:</p><p>Another significant enigma heading into Season 6 revolves around the fate of Aaron Thorsen after he and Celina Juarez were assaulted by a group of gunmen. While his initial surgery appeared to be successful, the final moments of the episode raised concerns as a code blue was announced from his hospital room, leaving his condition uncertain.</p><p>On a more positive note, The Rookie may also feature a wedding in the near future as John Nolan and Bailey Nunes have been a couple since Season 4 and engaged since early in the latest season. Perhaps now is the opportune moment for them to exchange vows amidst the squad’s latest set of troubles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rookie Season 6 Trailer:</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The official trailer for the Season 5 of The Rookie series has been released.

In the season finale, titled “Under Siege,” Thorsen and Juarez were ambushed while on their way home, after a late night of playing Dungeons & Dragons. As they split up to search the alley, Thorsen was unexpectedly attacked, and Juarez rushed to his aid, only to be surprised and rendered unconscious by one assailant. Before losing consciousness, one of the masked men whispered Juarez a strange rhyme.</p><p>They rushed both Thorsen and Juarez to the hospital, where Thorsen underwent surgery and Juarez relayed the rhyme to Nolan before losing consciousness once again. Nolan returned home to Bailey, but soon noticed one of the masked men outside their kitchen window. Confronting the intruder, Nolan discovered the mask, indicating that the attacker was now inside the house and targeting Bailey. However, Bailey fought back valiantly, even stabbing the attacker with a knife. Despite this, the assailant persisted until Nolan intervened and shot him in the shoulder. The investigation revealed that the attacker was a highly paid mercenary.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nyla and James were at home when Nyla spotted a masked man on the baby monitor. By the time they reached Leah’s room, the crib was empty. Pursuing the culprits, Nyla and James eventually located Leah unharmed in the bushes.</p><p>At the hospital, Angela and Wes were working on solving the riddle related to the rhyme that Juarez received. With the help of Grey’s wife, Luna, they deciphered the final line of the riddle, which read, “TRAP EVIL A REVILED GOD,” showing a connection to a short-lived L.A. play that featured the creepy masks worn by the suspects. Upon arriving at the home of a goon named Gracco, who had purchased the masks, the team discovered his dead body and booby traps.</p><p>Following a lead, the team identified seven individuals with a grudge against the Mid-Wilshire Division and connections to Gracco. Lucy and Tim took on approaching one of the lower-risk suspects, Luke Moran, only to realize it was a trap. As a platoon of mask-wearing goons brandishing riot shields closed in on them, Lucy and Tim quickly ascended the stairs outside, turning the tables on their attackers with a skillful and fierce confrontation. Eventually, Nolan and the rest of the team arrived at the scene to provide support, and Moran met his end by provoking the police. Nyla showcased her sniper skills by eliminating stragglers who threatened Chenford.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rookie Season 5 Rating:</span></h2><p>According to critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Season 5 of The Rookie has <a href=#>garnered positive reviews</a>.
