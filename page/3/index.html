This is obviously the O.G. of MLB rivalries, and one with enough history for a 20,000-word entry on Wikipedia.
It is, however, a rivalry that's had its ups and downs over the years. With the Yankees having dominated three of the last four season series and the two clubs not on the same contention level in 2023, it's stuck in one of the latter for now.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The 40 Most Intimidating Players in NFL History | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../763948-40-most-intimidating-players-in-nfl-history.html></a>
When you really think about it, the game of football is all about intimidation. Quarterbacks try to intimidate opposing defenses with arm strength and precision, while middle linebackers go the more conventional route of intimidation by delivering crushing blows to running backs and wide receivers.
Defensive players initially come to mind when we think of intimidation, but lightning-quick runners, stonewall offensive lineman, and deep-threat wideouts have just as easily struck fear into opponents throughout the years.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>1 NFL Player Who Will Make or Break Every Super Bowl Contender in 2024 | News, Scores, Highlights, S</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

The aging veteran spent the 2023 season with the New England Patriots after the Cowboys released him well before his blockbuster six-year, $90 million contract extension ran out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best thing I ate: This sandwich contains a cheeseburger, brisket AND a bone-in smoked rib</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>

Behold the MAC Rib Burger. I typically do not get excited about carnival food served in restaurants. But I’m making an exception for this beast of a sandwich because everything about it is delicious and I can’t stop thinking about it.
I’m not going to debate whether something can technically be called a burger when it’s made with toasted bread instead of a bun. You’ll have to take that up with the chef.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/2/>← Prev Page</a>
