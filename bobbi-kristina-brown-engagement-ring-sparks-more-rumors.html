<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Bobbi Kristina Brown Engagement Ring Sparks More Rumors</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>UPDATE-<a href=# rel=noopener>Bobbi Kristina Brown</a> seems to be taking after mother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Whitney Houston</a>, in more ways than one. The 19 year old daughter of the pop icon has been all over the news lately, due to claims that she’s been dating her “adopted” brother Nick Gordon. Nick has made it clear that he is in no way related to Bobbi Kristina, and claims that Whitney referred to him only as her Godson. Although, Whitney had never officially adopted Gordon, he had been a part of their family since he was 12 years old. This has alarmed many people who believe that the two should have more of a sibling relationship than a romantic one.</p><p>One source told <a href=# rel=noopener>US Weekly</a>, “The situation is beyond sad. Whitney never formally adopted Nick, but he lived with her and Bobbi Kristina from the age of twelve and they were raised like brother and sister. Nick came from a really bad background.”</p><p>However, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bobbi Kristina doesn’t seem to care</a> one bit about how people view her relationship with Gordon. Just last week the couple was spotted out and about, publicly showing each other affection. The plot began to thicken even more when rumors quickly spread that the two were engaged. To add insult to injury, Bobbi Kristina was seen again with Gordon, but this time, she wore a little something on her finger. As the new couple came out of an AT&T store in Atlanta, Bobbi could be seen wearing a huge diamond ring. It appeared to be the wedding ring that her mother once wore, reportedly worth a quarter million dollars. Bobbi also wore a “Nothing but Love” tour sweater honoring the late great Whitney Houston.</p><p>Bobbi’s grandmother is reportedly unhappy with the new couple. According to TMZ, Cissy Houston has called the relationship between her grandchild and Nick Gordon incestuous. Cissy allegedly told a friend that she fears Gordon is taking advantage of Bobbi, and should be removed from Whitney’s million dollar home, where he is currently staying with her granddaughter. The source added that many believe that Bobby Brown’s only daughter with Whitney is vulnerable,</p><p>“Bobbi Kristina is still so vulnerable since her mother passed away.”</p><p>Interesting, a relationship in which a rebellious young woman openly shows affection to a man who supposedly has a negative influence on her, and is disliked by Cissy Houston? Sounds incredibly familiar.</p><p>See pictures of Bobbi Kristina Brown’s engagement ring:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX5ze49sZmpxX5e8o67IZqKroaOptq%2BtjJupqK%2BeYrKvs8CgnKadnql6s7XNoGSsqJGnuLR5zKipnmWiqrqwvtJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-murphys-son-eric-martin-lawrences-daughter-jasmin-are-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Murphy's Son Eric &amp;amp; Martin Lawrence's Daughter Jasmin Are Dating!</span></a>
