In a social media post the UCLA basketball star shows off her incredible body in a bathing suit while taking a dip in the ocean. She shared the images via her Instagram Stories, driving her followers wild. "Hotttüòç" commented one of them. "a slay all arounddddd," a second chimed in. How does the college athlete approach diet and fitness? Here is everything you need to know about her lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Betts maintains that working out her mind has been beneficial. Her coach at UCLA puts all the players through "mind gym" to boost confidence. "This program and honestly <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Coach Cori</a> have been doing a really good job of filling me with a lot of positivity and all the things I'm capable of doing. All the negativity that I saw about myself before I got here, it kind of just brought me back to normal," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>LA Times</span></a><span>. The nine-month curriculum focuses on developing mental toughness. For example, it has taught her to pay herself compliments.</span></p><p><span>Lauren makes sure to hydrate. She is also a fan of Chargel, a gel-drink in an on-the-go pouch fueled with five essential B vitamins. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span></p><p><span>Lauren also enjoys soaking in hot water. Here she is with her friends in a hot tub in Cabo. Why should you take a soak? It can help improve your sleep and possibly ease anxiety and depression. One recent </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>study</span></a><span> found that taking baths, similar to soaking in a hot tub, may even boast cardiovascular benefits.</span></p><p><span>Lauren enjoys surfing, but don't expect her to change careers anytime soon. "Sticking to basketball‚Ä¶.. that is all," she joked in this caption. According to the Australian government's </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Better Health</span></a><span>, surfing provides many health benefits including cardiovascular fitness from paddling, shoulder and back strength, which also strengthens from the paddling, and leg and core strength. "Once you're standing up on the board, strong legs and a strong core will keep you up," they say.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lauren spends hours every day playing hoops.&nbsp; "Basketball promotes speed, agility, strength, power and endurance. It [has] also been shown to increase flexibility and motor coordination. As a result, basketball is uniquely oriented to improve fundamental motor skills that are shown to be beneficial in promoting general health," Koco Eaton, M.D., orthopedic surgeon, founder of Eaton Orthopaedics and a former basketball player, tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Nike</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK2t1Kucp2WSmsG1v4ysn6ivo2K8p7KMn6CtZZaetLa%2BxGadq6edYsGpsYycmLKlkaPAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ali-wong-net-worth.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Ali Wong Net Worth: Ali Wongs Net Worth And Her Rise To Comedic Stardom</span></a>
