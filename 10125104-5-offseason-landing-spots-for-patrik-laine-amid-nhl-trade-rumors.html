In January, he <a href=# rel=noopener>entered</a> the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program to focus on his mental health and well-being where he spent the remainder of the season.</p><p>Laine's tenure with the Blue Jackets has been disappointing. Acquired from the Winnipeg Jets early in the COVID-shortened 2020-21 season, he's been hampered by injuries ever since. He has two seasons remaining <a href=# rel=noopener>on his contract</a> with an average annual value of $8.7 million and a 10-team no-trade list.</p><p>Selected second overall by the Jets in the 2016 NHL draft, he had the making of a scoring star. He netted 36 goals in his 2016-17 rookie season, followed by a 44-goal performance in his sophomore year. His production dropped to 30 goals and 50 points in 2018-19, but he had 28 goals and 63 points in 68 games before COVID ended the 2019-20 season.</p><p>LeBrun indicated Laine seeks a fresh start elsewhere. Given his contract and injury history, he's not sure what the market will be for the 26-year-old, but his potential for a bounce-back performance could make him enticing for clubs seeking more scoring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp%2BcYCMbmSonpaosqK%2FzqdkpZmembavs4ysp6iso2KzsL6MqZitqpmgeq2tyKecZpmdnrFuuselZK2qkZmybr7Upqarqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-farrah-britt-still-engaged.html><span>←</span><span>Is Farrah Britt Still Engaged?
