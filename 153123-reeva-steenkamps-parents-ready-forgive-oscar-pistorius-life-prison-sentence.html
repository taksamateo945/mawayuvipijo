He stuck to his story that he thought it was an intruder. After all these years we are still waiting for him to admit he did it in anger. That is all we wanted."If he told me the truth, he would have been a free man by now and I would have let the law take its course over his parole. But I was wasting my time. He is a murderer. He should remain in jail."<h2>Reeva Steenkamp's mother says she hasn't forgiven Oscar Pistorius</h2><p class=align-left>Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, reportedly refused to attend the rehabilitation programme to meet Pistorius, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimesLIVE</a></i> reports. She reportedly wrote him a letter. She said:</p>"Oscar has taken a lot away from us and from Reeva. So now, instead of getting upset, I get angry. I am angry with him.
